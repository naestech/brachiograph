brachiograph (armwriter)
==========================================================
the brachiograph is a ultra-cheap pen plotter that can be built with minimal skills. at it's heart is a raspberry pi zero and some custom python software that drives 3 servo motors. the mechanical hardware is built from 2 popsicle sticks, a clothespin holding a pen, and some hot glue. everything is attached together with a mini breadboard.
